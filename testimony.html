      <div class="news-text small" style="max-height: 400px; overflow-y: auto; line-height: 1.4;">
        
        <p><strong><em>The Land of Blessings</em></strong></p>

        <p>The land of blessings, a land where <strong>God‚Äôs grace and providence flow</strong>, a land more blessed than the promised land of <em>Canaan</em>. Ever wonder if it could ever be true? Would the Lord work miracles and bless, provide, and care like He did for the Israelites? Well, most of us would argue that what the Lord had done for the Israelites was according to His divine special providence for them. <em>It is not okay to say the Almighty God could do miracles in today‚Äôs time.</em></p>

        <p>Well, I would argue against this notion, because <strong>God is still working</strong>. As Jesus said: <em>‚ÄúMy Father is always at his work to this very day, and I too am working.‚Äù</em> <strong>(John 5:17)</strong>. And indeed, He has done something great for all of us. Let me begin with a land that was and still is a land of blessings ‚Äî a land where God‚Äôs people dwelled and He was with them, caring, providing, and blessing.</p>

        <p>This beautiful land is in the valley of <strong>Dehradun</strong>; it is called <strong><em>Prathyasha Bal Bhavan</em></strong>. The meaning of this name is <em>‚ÄúA Home of Hope for the Children.‚Äù</em> It‚Äôs a beautiful land, large and filled with love and care.</p>

        <p>I was just <strong>4 years old</strong>. At this tiny age of my life, the Lord brought me to this beautiful place. I was among those whom the Lord placed in this wonderful home ‚Äî from the time when I didn‚Äôt understand anything, to the time when I realized what the Lord had done for me. <em>The Triune God kept me here.</em> I may never fully understand why I was chosen to be blessed while many others like me never got the chance to experience this providence and grace.</p>

        <p>This land is filled with many <strong>mango trees</strong>, each with different tastes and flavors. These trees are witnesses to what the Lord had done for us. They provided fruits, shade, and protection. But this was just a small glimpse of the greater blessings to come.</p>

        <p>We even had other plants and trees, animals and birds, and more than enough land for games. <em>More land meant more experiences, more skill, and more knowledge.</em> This land truly had it all.</p>

        <p>Not once could our mouths murmur like the Israelites who said, <em>‚ÄúWe were better at our homes.‚Äù</em> And one of the reasons for that was because <strong>Prathyasha Bal Bhavan was, and still is, our home.</strong> I cannot recall a single day when I slept hungry, nor a single time I was denied food ‚Äî even a second serving, if there was enough. <em>We always had enough.</em></p>

        <p>Being from a poor family, my parents might never have imagined that they could educate us. But the Lord didn‚Äôt just provide education ‚Äî <strong>He provided us with an English-medium education.</strong> Education today is one of the most valuable and expensive resources, and yet the Lord gave it in this land not just to me but to over <strong>60 children</strong>.</p>

        <p>Here‚Äôs the most amazing detail: I have completed my <strong>Master‚Äôs degree</strong>, but to this very day, I do not know who paid my fees. <em>This land is not just a place, but a symbol of God‚Äôs lavishing heart ‚Äî pouring blessings as though it were nothing.</em></p>

        <p><strong>I'm LAKSHMI NAIDU.</strong> <em>From Rags to Rugs!!</em> Sounds like a long journey, doesn‚Äôt it?</p>

        <p>I still remember the very first day I stepped into the Home ‚Äî a shriveled, feeble girl, feeling unnoticed and unloved.</p>

        <p>But today, when I look back, I still wonder to myself ‚Äî <em>Am I the same Lakshmi?</em> It's hard to believe and even harder for others to believe and digest this truth ‚Äî that I am now a reputed <strong>Physiotherapist</strong>.</p>

        <p>I truly believe it is only because of the <strong>faithfulness of an unchanging God</strong>.</p>

        <p>I thank <strong>Uncle John and Aunty Deepa</strong> from the bottom of my heart for their consistent love for me and for helping me reach this far.</p>

        <p><strong>Hello everyone,</strong></p>
        <p>My name is <strong>Nadesh Kannaya</strong>, and I feel truly blessed to share my story with you today. In 1992, I was lovingly welcomed into <strong>Prathyasha Bal Bhawan</strong> along with my siblings, coming from a humble background.</p>

        <p>From the very first day, this place became more than a shelter ‚Äî it became my true home, filled with love and warmth where I grew in <em>heart, faith, and hope</em>.</p>

        <blockquote class="bible-verse">"Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good; His love endures forever." ‚Äì <em>Psalm 107:1</em></blockquote>

        <p>Every meal, prayer, lesson, and act of care shaped me. I am especially grateful to <strong>Uncle John</strong> and <strong>Aunty Deepa</strong>, who raised us with love and discipline for nearly two decades.</p>

        <p>Thanks to them, I studied at <strong>Grace Academy</strong> from nursery to Grade 12 ‚Äî a journey that was once unimaginable.</p>

        <p>Today, as a <strong>teacher</strong>, I stand here confident, educated, and grounded in faith, because of this nurturing home.</p>

        <blockquote class="bible-verse">‚ÄúTrain up a child in the way he should go; even when he is old he will not depart from it.‚Äù ‚Äì <em>Proverbs 22:6</em></blockquote>

        <blockquote class="bible-verse">‚ÄúI will give thanks to You, Lord, with all my heart; I will tell of all Your wonderful deeds.‚Äù ‚Äì <em>Psalm 9:1</em></blockquote>

        <p><strong>Thank you, Prathyasha Bal Bhawan.</strong><br>You are a gift from God. I will forever be grateful.</p>
