<h2>Our Facilities</h2><p>A Home Designed for Joy, Growth...</p>
<p> Prathyasa Bal Bhawan is more than just a shelter—it is a vibrant, child-friendly space nestled in the peaceful hillside of Majhaun, Dehradun, surrounded by nature’s beauty and filled with opportunities for learning, play, and personal growth.
</p>
<p>Our campus offers a spacious playground where children can run, play, and engage in a variety of sports and games. The grounds are dotted with mango trees and greenery, offering shade and a sense of freedom. We also have play equipment tailored for our younger children, making outdoor time both fun and safe.</p>
<p> What makes our home truly special is its miniature animal farm. Children learn responsibility and compassion by caring for our cows, ducks, pigeons, rabbits, guinea pigs, chickens, and even dogs. Our aquarium of ornamental fishes adds beauty and calm to the space, while our well-kept gardens with flowering and decorative plants create a peaceful environment for reflection and learning.</p>
<p> Our accommodation facilities are clean, safe, and well-ventilated, designed to give every child a sense of belonging. The kitchen is well-equipped, and our cook lovingly prepares nutritious and varied meals, introducing children to a wide range of flavors. Additionally, the children are trained in cooking, cleaning, and basic maintenance, instilling life skills and self-reliance from a young age.</p>

<p>Set against the backdrop of mountains, rivers, and scenic walking trails, Prathyasa Bal Bhawan offers an environment that naturally encourages health, exploration, and emotional well-being. </p>

<p> Our children excel not just in academics, but also in sports, arts, music, and other extracurricular activities—a reflection of the holistic care and opportunities they receive here.
</p>
<p> At Prathyasa, every corner of the home is built with love, purpose, and a vision for a brighter future.</p>
