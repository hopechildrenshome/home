  <p> Prathyasa Bal Bhawan, located in Poundha village, Dehradun, Uttarakhand, is a nurturing children's home run under the care of the Hope for Children Society — a faith-led initiative committed to transforming the lives of underprivileged and vulnerable children.
</p>
<p> Founded on the values of compassion, dignity, and opportunity, our mission is to offer a safe, supportive, and loving environment where every child can grow intellectually, emotionally, and spiritually. At Prathyasa Bal Bhawan, we welcome children from broken families, orphaned or semi-orphaned backgrounds, and marginalized communities. Through structured care, education, and mentoring, we help them reclaim hope and build a meaningful future.</p>
<p> We currently house around 35 children, supporting them in their education from early school years through higher education. Our children attend regular schools and are encouraged to pursue both academic and co-curricular excellence. We celebrate their achievements and milestones — be it in board exams, college admissions, or professional training — with immense pride and gratitude.</p>
<p>
  In addition to education, we focus on life skills, health, hygiene, and spiritual grounding. Many of our alumni have gone on to become healthcare professionals, educators, and responsible citizens, some even returning to support and serve at the Home.
</p>
<p>
  Through the tireless efforts of our caretakers and the grace of God, Prathyasa Bal Bhawan continues to stand as a beacon of hope and transformation — one child, one life, one future at a time.
