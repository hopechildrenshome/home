<p><strong>Prathyasha Bal Bhawan</strong>, located in the serene hills of <strong>Poundha village, Dehradun</strong>, is a nurturing children’s home operated by the <strong>Hope for Children Society</strong> - a faith-led initiative committed to transforming the lives of underprivileged and vulnerable children. Founded in <strong>1991</strong> on the values of compassion, dignity, and opportunity, our mission is to offer a safe, supportive, and loving environment where every child can grow intellectually, emotionally, and spiritually.</p>
<p>The vision for this home was born in the heart of <strong>Mr. John Varghese</strong> while he was a student at the <strong>Presbyterian Theological Seminary</strong> in Dehradun. A visit to <em>Madras Colony</em> - a community of rag pickers - deeply impacted him. After two years of outreach work, he realized that to truly transform these children's lives, they needed to be removed from environments of poverty and despair and raised in a morally and socially healthy space. Together with <strong>Mrs. Deepa Varghese</strong>, the dream became a reality.</p>
<p>At Prathyasha Bal Bhawan, we welcome children from broken families, orphaned or semi-orphaned backgrounds, and marginalized communities. Through structured care, mentoring, and holistic education, we help them reclaim hope and build a meaningful future. Today, we are home to around <strong>35 children</strong>, supporting their journey from early schooling through higher education. Our children attend local schools and are encouraged to pursue both academic and co-curricular excellence. We proudly celebrate every achievement - be it success in board exams, college admissions, or professional training. Many of our alumni have gone on to become healthcare professionals, educators, and responsible citizens - some even returning to serve at the Home that once nurtured them.</p>
<p>Beyond academics, we focus on life skills, health, hygiene, character-building, and spiritual grounding. With the tireless dedication of our caretakers and the grace of God, <strong>Prathyasha Bal Bhawan</strong> continues to be a beacon of hope - <em>one child, one life, one future at a time</em>.</p>
</br><h6><strong>Who Are Rag Pickers?</strong></h6>
<p>You can find them in almost every Indian city—often in tattered clothes, with unwashed bodies, scavenging through garbage dumps and dustbins for anything of value or that can be recycled. Most of them are <strong>women and children</strong>, living in overcrowded slums or colonies surrounded by heaps of plastic, metal scraps, and other discarded items. When they fail to gather enough recyclable material to sell, some are forced into <strong>petty theft</strong> for survival. The hopelessness of their existence drives many into <strong>alcoholism</strong>, <strong>drug abuse</strong>, <strong>prostitution</strong>, and other vices. A visit to a rag pickers’ colony can be a <strong>disturbing experience</strong>. But it is their <strong>children</strong> who suffer the most. From early morning, they’re on the streets—often hungry, unwashed, and exposed to every kind of danger. Going to school is rarely an option. Even if they wish to learn, there's no one to support or guide them. These children grow up <strong>abused</strong>, in extremely <strong>unhygienic and unsafe conditions</strong>, and are tragically vulnerable to every form of exploitation and evil.</p>
