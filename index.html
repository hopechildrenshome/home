  <p>Located in the serene hills of <strong>Poundha village, Dehradun</strong>, Prathyasha Bal Bhawan is a vibrant children’s home run by the <strong>Hope for Children Society</strong>, dedicated to nurturing orphaned and vulnerable children with love, education, and dignity.</p>
  <p>More than shelter, we offer a <strong>life</strong>—filled with learning, laughter, care, and growth. From academic support and spiritual grounding to animal care, life skills, and leadership, our children thrive in a setting that truly feels like <strong>family</strong>.</p>

  <hr class="my-4"/>
  <h4 class="text-primary">Our Origin</h4>
  <p><strong>Prathyasha Bal Bhawan</strong> was established in <strong>1991</strong> to care for the children of rag pickers and other children in distress, providing them with education and opportunities for development. It is operated by the <strong>Hope for Children Society</strong>, a registered organization. The Home is directed by <strong>Mr. John Varghese</strong> and <strong>Mrs. Deepa Varghese</strong>.</p>
  <p>The vision for this ministry began in the heart of Mr. John Varghese when he was a student at the <strong>Presbyterian Theological Seminary</strong> in Dehradun, India. His first visit to <em>Madras Colony</em>—a settlement of rag pickers—left a deep burden on his heart for the children living there. After two years of outreach work, he realized that long-term transformation could only happen if these children were removed from such environments and raised in a morally and socially healthy setting.</p>

  <hr class="my-4"/>
  <h4 class="text-primary">Who Are Rag Pickers?</h4>
  <p>You can find them in almost every Indian city—often in tattered clothes, with unwashed bodies, scavenging through garbage dumps and dustbins for anything of value or that can be recycled. Most of them are <strong>women and children</strong>, living in overcrowded slums or colonies surrounded by heaps of plastic, metal scraps, and other discarded items.</p>
  <p>When they fail to gather enough recyclable material to sell, some are forced into <strong>petty theft</strong> for survival. The hopelessness of their existence drives many into <strong>alcoholism</strong>, <strong>drug abuse</strong>, <strong>prostitution</strong>, and other vices.</p>
  <p>A visit to a rag pickers’ colony can be a <strong>disturbing experience</strong>. But it is their <strong>children</strong> who suffer the most. From early morning, they’re on the streets—often hungry, unwashed, and exposed to every kind of danger. Going to school is rarely an option. Even if they wish to learn, there's no one to support or guide them. These children grow up <strong>abused</strong>, in extremely <strong>unhygienic and unsafe conditions</strong>, and are tragically vulnerable to every form of exploitation and evil.</p>
