      <h1>A Home of Hope, Healing, and Growth</h1>
      <p>
        Prathyasa Bal Bhawan, located in Majhaun, Dehradun, Uttarakhand, is a nurturing children's home run under the care of the Hope for Children Society — a faith-led initiative committed to transforming the lives of underprivileged and vulnerable children.

Founded on the values of compassion, dignity, and opportunity, our mission is to offer a safe, supportive, and loving environment where every child can grow intellectually, emotionally, and spiritually. At Prathyasa Bal Bhawan, we welcome children from broken families, orphaned or semi-orphaned backgrounds, and marginalized communities. Through structured care, education, and mentoring, we help them reclaim hope and build a meaningful future.

We currently house around 35 children, supporting them in their education from early school years through higher education. Our children attend regular schools and are encouraged to pursue both academic and co-curricular excellence. We celebrate their achievements and milestones — be it in board exams, college admissions, or professional training — with immense pride and gratitude.

In addition to education, we focus on life skills, health, hygiene, and spiritual grounding. Many of our alumni have gone on to become healthcare professionals, educators, and responsible citizens, some even returning to support and serve at the Home.

Through the tireless efforts of our caretakers and the grace of God, Prathyasa Bal Bhawan continues to stand as a beacon of hope and transformation — one child, one life, one future at a time.

We remain deeply thankful to our donors, prayer partners, volunteers, and well-wishers, whose faith and support make this mission possible.

      <h2>A Home Designed for Joy, Growth, and Learning</h2>
Prathyasa Bal Bhawan is more than just a shelter—it is a vibrant, child-friendly space nestled in the peaceful hillside of Majhaun, Dehradun, surrounded by nature’s beauty and filled with opportunities for learning, play, and personal growth.

Our campus offers a spacious playground where children can run, play, and engage in a variety of sports and games. The grounds are dotted with mango trees and greenery, offering shade and a sense of freedom. We also have play equipment tailored for our younger children, making outdoor time both fun and safe.

What makes our home truly special is its miniature animal farm. Children learn responsibility and compassion by caring for our cows, ducks, pigeons, rabbits, guinea pigs, chickens, and even dogs. Our aquarium of ornamental fishes adds beauty and calm to the space, while our well-kept gardens with flowering and decorative plants create a peaceful environment for reflection and learning.

Our accommodation facilities are clean, safe, and well-ventilated, designed to give every child a sense of belonging. The kitchen is well-equipped, and our cook lovingly prepares nutritious and varied meals, introducing children to a wide range of flavors. Additionally, the children are trained in cooking, cleaning, and basic maintenance, instilling life skills and self-reliance from a young age.

Set against the backdrop of mountains, rivers, and scenic walking trails, Prathyasa Bal Bhawan offers an environment that naturally encourages health, exploration, and emotional well-being.

Our children excel not just in academics, but also in sports, arts, music, and other extracurricular activities—a reflection of the holistic care and opportunities they receive here.

At Prathyasa, every corner of the home is built with love, purpose, and a vision for a brighter future.
