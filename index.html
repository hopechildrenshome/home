      <p>
        At Hope Haven, we believe every child deserves a safe, loving, and nurturing environment.
        Inspired by the verse:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        "He will cover you with his feathers, and under his wings you will find refuge."
        <br><strong>â€” Psalm 91:4</strong>
